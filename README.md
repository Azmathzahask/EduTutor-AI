# EduTutor-AI

EduTutor AI is an advanced AI-Powered Personalized Learning and Assessment System designed to transform education by providing individualized learning experiences for students while streamlining instructional planning for educators. In traditional classrooms, a standardized teaching approach often fails to cater to diverse learning styles, leading to disengagement and gaps in understanding. Additionally, manual grading and feedback take up valuable teacher time, delaying essential support for students.  

It addresses these challenges by integrating Generative AI, real-time learning analytics, and automated assessments, creating an adaptive environment tailored to each studentâ€™s needs. The platform tracks student progress, maps learned concepts in a Knowledge Constellation, and suggests Gap-Filling Missions to reinforce weaker areas. Its AI-driven Curriculum Co-Pilot assists educators by generating differentiated content, customized assessments, and instructional recommendations, significantly reducing their workload.  

Rather than replacing teachers, it serves as an intelligent assistant, ensuring personalized education while empowering educators with data-driven insights. By fostering engagement, improving efficiency, and promoting inclusive learning, EduTutor AI is positioned as a game-changing solution in modern education.
